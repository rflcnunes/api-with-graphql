# Project Description: Study GraphQL with Apollo Server

This project is designed for educational purposes and serves as a practical exploration of GraphQL using Apollo Server. GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows efficient and flexible data retrieval from the server to the client. By combining GraphQL with Apollo Server, we can create a robust and scalable backend architecture for our application.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to deepen my understanding of GraphQL and learn its implementation with Apollo Server. 

## Technologies Used:
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server
- json-server
- nodemon

## Node and NPM Versions:
Node.js: v19.9.0
npm: 9.6.3
